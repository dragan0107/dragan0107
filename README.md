## Hi there 👋 My name is ***Dragan***, and I'm a JavaScript developer, focusing on `MERN` stack. I enjoy both Front and Back-end side of the applications. 
### Programming is something I really enjoy, and there's always something cool and interesting to learn.

- 💻 Currently, I'm also working on some Full-stack applications to get enough practice and get more comfortable with these technologies.
- 🌱 At the moment, I'm leveling up my knowledge of React. 
- 🤔 I’m always looking for a way to write a more efficient code, and structure my applications properly.
- ✍️ I like writing and keeping my **_README.md_** files tidy so I try to improve on that as well :)

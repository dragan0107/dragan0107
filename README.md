## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is ***Dragan***, and I'm a JavaScript developer, focusing on `MERN` stack. I enjoy both Front and Backend side of the applications. 
Programming is something I really enjoy, and there's always something cool and interesting to learn. 

- ðŸ’» Currently, I'm working on some Full-stack applications to practice all the knowledge I acquire over time.
- ðŸŒ± At the moment, I'm leveling up my knowledge of React. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m always looking for a way to write a more efficient `code`, and structure my applications properly.
- ðŸ’¬ As of now, I'm looking for an internship, or a Junior position.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me out via e-mail: s.dragan016@gmail.com - Discord: DRIP#4832

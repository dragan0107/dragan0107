### Hi there 👋 My name is Dragan, and I'm a self-taught JavaScript developer, focusing on MERN stack. I enjoy both Front and Backend side. 
I'm always looking forward to learn as much and get a bigger picture about programming and tools I use.

- 💻 I’m currently working on some Full-stack applications to practice all the knowledge I acquire over time..
- 🌱 I’m currently leveling up my knowledge of React. 
- 🤔 I’m constantly trying to get better, and to get a good grasp about how these technologies exactly work in the background.
- 💬 As of now, I think I possess enough knowledge for an internship, or a Junior position.
- 📫 Reach me out via e-mail: s.dragan016@gmail.com - Discord: DRIP#4832

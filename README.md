### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Dragan, and I'm a self-taught JavaScript developer, focusing on MERN stack. I enjoy both Front and Backend side,
I'm trying to learn about both as much as I can.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some Full-stack applications to practice all the knowledge I acquire over time..
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about React.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m constantly trying to get better, and to get a good grasp about how these technologies exactly work in the background.
- ðŸ’¬ As of know, I think I possess enough knowledge for an internship, or Junior position.
